---------------

I've tried to preserve the Avalanche Wallet SDK and other related original Ava Labs projects' package and folder structure where possible.

I hope this makes the Java version more intuitive to use and understand.

When in doubt, please refer to the original documentation and source code. The data structures and algos have been preserved, where possible.
